VIT LIKE AND DISLIKES?

VIT is a land of opportunity. You will get an opportunity to excel in any field you like. Let me give you an example,

Certainly! Here's an example of how you might answer the question **"Tell me about a time when you misjudged someone"** based on your honest experiences:

**"In one of the clubs I was a part of, we were working on a collaborative project, and I was assigned to coordinate with different team members. There was one team member who was very quiet and reserved during our initial meetings. Based on their silence, I misjudged them as being disengaged or uninterested in the project. I mistakenly assumed that they weren’t committed, so I didn’t prioritize involving them in the decision-making process or group discussions."**

**"However, as the project progressed, I realized that their approach to communication was different—they preferred to observe and think through ideas before contributing. When I finally took the time to engage with them more directly, they shared some incredibly thoughtful insights and solutions that significantly improved the project's direction."**

**"This experience taught me that people can contribute in different ways, and that initial impressions don’t always reflect someone's abilities or commitment. I learned to be more open-minded and not to judge someone's level of involvement based on how they communicate. Since then, I’ve made it a point to ensure that I engage all team members more equally, regardless of their communication style."**
